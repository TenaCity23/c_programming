A portfolio of C Programming Projects


### Main Projects
In the [main_projects](https://github.com/TenaCity23/c_programming/tree/main/main_projects) folder is a compilation of my own C Prorgamming Projects that I have completed. Down below are provided links to them: 

* [Anagram Project](https://github.com/TenaCity23/c_programming/blob/main/main_projects/anagram.c): This is a code to find if two strings have the same letters.
* [Calendar Project](https://github.com/TenaCity23/c_programming/blob/main/main_projects/calendar.c): This is a calendar calculator I made to:
  - calculate whether a year entered is a leap year or not.
  - receive a specific date, caluclate the amount of days added to it, and print out a new, correct date.
