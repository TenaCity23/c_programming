A portfolio of C Programming Projects


### Main Projects
In the [main_projects](https://github.com/TenaCity23/c_programming/tree/main/main_projects) folder is a compilation of my best C Prorgamming Projects that I have completed:

* [Calendar Project](https://github.com/TenaCity23/c_programming/blob/main/main_projects/calendar.c): The program calculates whether a year entered is a leap year or not and receives a specific date, caluclates the amount of days added to it, and prints out a new date.

* [Encrypting Message](https://github.com/TenaCity23/c_programming/blob/main/main_projects/encrypting_message.c): The user enters a sentence they want to encrypt and a shift value for the encryption. The program will display the final encrypted message to the user.

* [Racing Winner](https://github.com/TenaCity23/c_programming/blob/main/main_projects/race.c): A code that prints out the victor randomly based on the least amount of time they complete the final lap. 

* [Anagrams](https://github.com/TenaCity23/c_programming/blob/main/main_projects/anagram.c): A code to find if two strings have the same letters.

* [Digit Counting](https://github.com/TenaCity23/c_programming/blob/main/main_projects/digit_occurances.c): The user enters a line of numbers and the program will display the numbers that were repeated.


### Other Projects
Some other miscellaneous projects I've completed could be found in the [other_projects](https://github.com/TenaCity23/c_programming/tree/main/other_projects) folder. These are often project exercises I completed for fun and practice!
