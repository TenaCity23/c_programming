A portfolio of C Programming Projects


### Main Projects
In the [main_projects](https://github.com/TenaCity23/c_programming/tree/main/main_projects) folder is a compilation of my best C Prorgamming Projects that I have completed:

* [Anagram Project](https://github.com/TenaCity23/c_programming/blob/main/main_projects/anagram.c): This is a code to find if two strings have the same letters.

* [Calendar Project](https://github.com/TenaCity23/c_programming/blob/main/main_projects/calendar.c): This is a calendar calculator I made to:
  - calculate whether a year entered is a leap year or not.
  - receive a specific date, caluclate the amount of days added to it, and print out a new, correct date.

* [Digit Counting Project(https://github.com/TenaCity23/c_programming/blob/main/main_projects/digit_occurances.c): A user enters a line of numbers and the program will display the numbers that were repeated.
